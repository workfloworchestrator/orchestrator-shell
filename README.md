# wfoshell

The wfoshell (WorkFlow Orchestrator Shell) is an interactive shell to navigate
through subscriptions product blocks and resource types, and update
subscriptions and resource types directly in the database. The use of the GNU
Readline interface allows for command completion and history, as wel as command
line editing and search.

For various reasons, it sometimes happens that incorrect information ends up in
the WFO database. Those who know the database model can of course adjust this
information directly in the database with self-made SQL queries. For those who
prefer an easy way to navigate through the subscriptions, product blocks and
resource types to adjust incorrect information, can use the wfoshell.

## Getting started

The wfoshell is tested with Python version 3.12.

Install the required Python modules:

```shell
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

And start the shell:

```shell
python main.py
```

## Warning

The shell operates directly on the database, changes made are instantly
commited to the database. While using the shell, try to avoid other write
access to the database, or at least limit write access to the information you
are touching. Also note that none of the information that is updated in the
database is checked syntactically or in any other way, except for the insync,
start_date and end_date subscription fields, these fields will not allow
syntactically incorrect values.  Updating information in the database with
unsupported values may brake things. Use this shell at your own risk.

Only scalar resource types are supported. All non-scalar resource types are
shown as `<unset or non-scalar>` while they can have a value in the database.
Optional yet unset resource types can be assigned a value with the
`resource_type  update` command, but do not try to update non-scalar resource
types using the wfoshell.

## Usage

### Command overview

The following commands are supported. Each command has its own help on their
subcommands.

```text
(wfo) help --verbose

Documented commands (use 'help -v' for verbose/'help <topic>' for details):
======================================================================================================
exit                  Exit the application.
help                  List available commands or provide detailed help for a specific command
history               View, run, edit, save, or clear previously entered commands
product_block         List and select product blocks, show details, or follow depends on and in use by
                      product blocks.
quit                  Exit this application
resource_type         List, select and update resource types, and show details.
set                   Set a settable parameter or show current settings of parameters
state                 Show state summary or details.
subscription          List, search or select subscriptions, update fields, and show details.
```

The **subscription**, **product_block** and **resource_type** commands are used
to navigate through the database and update information. All three commands
have **list**, **select** and **details** subcommands, and the **subscription**
and **resource_type** commands have an **update** subcommand. These subcommands
are used to list the specific type of information, select an item to work with,
show more detailed information, and update information in the database. In
addition, the **subscription** command has a case insensitive **search**
subcommand to quickly find a subscription, and the **product_block** command
has **depends_on** and **in_use_by** subcommands to navigate through product
blocks and therewith through subscriptions.

### Examples

#### Select subscription to update description

This example shows how to list and select a subscription, show subscription
details, and update the subscription description. When the description is
generated by a workflow and uses other information like resource types, then
make sure to match the description witch the associated information.

#### Start with a port to find the node it is on

Search subscription by description and use the product block command to find
the associated node.

#### Select a resource type to update its value

Select a resource types on the currently selected product block to update its
value.  New values are not syntactically checked. Any relation that this
resource type has with other information in the WFO database or any related
external administration, should eventually match the new value to avoid
unexpected results using the WFO.
